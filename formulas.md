### Break-even Analysis and ROI

Conducting a break-even analysis is essential for understanding when your online poster business will start generating profit. This involves calculating both fixed and variable costs and determining the sales volume required to cover these expenses. Fixed costs include expenses such as website development, marketing campaigns, and salaries, which remain constant regardless of sales volume. Variable costs, on the other hand, fluctuate with production levels and include costs like printing, packaging, and shipping.

To perform a break-even analysis, you need to identify the break-even point, which is the number of units that must be sold to cover all costs. The formula for this is:

\[ \text{Break-even Point (units)} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}} \]

For example, if your fixed costs are $10,000, the selling price per poster is $50, and the variable cost per poster is $20, the break-even point would be:

\[ \frac{10,000}{50 - 20} = 334 \text{ posters} \]

This means you need to sell 334 posters to cover all your costs and start making a profit.

Return on investment (ROI) is another critical metric for assessing the efficiency of your investments. ROI measures the profitability of your investments relative to their cost and is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Total Investment}} \times 100 \]

For instance, if your total investment is $20,000 and your net profit after one year is $5,000, the ROI would be:

\[ \frac{5,000}{20,000} \times 100 = 25\% \]

A 25% ROI indicates that for every dollar invested, you earn 25 cents in profit. Regularly reviewing your ROI helps in making informed decisions about future investments and identifying areas for improvement.

By understanding these financial metrics, startups can set realistic financial goals, monitor their progress, and make data-driven decisions to ensure long-term success in the Danish online poster market.
